# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Christian alias secondtruth, a hobbyist web developer and tech enthusiast from Stuttgart (Germany), who loves open source.

:gear: I'm currently working on [FlameCore](http://github.com/flamecore), a set of PHP libraries for common use cases. Besides that, I'm also working on my [personal website](https://secondtruth.de) and several other small web projects.

:telescope: I'm currently learning C++ and the CMake build system.


## :toolbox: My Skills

![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=php,cpp,html,css,sass,bootstrap,nginx,docker,linux,idea,vscode&theme=light)

I love PHP and web technologies in general. I'm also a big fan of Linux, Nginx, Docker/Podman and other open source software. PhpStorm and Visual Studio Code are my favorite IDEs.


## :thumbsup: My other Interests

When I'm not taking care of my projects, I also like to play strategy games, building games, simulations or RPGs.

I love music, too. My taste is very mixed, but I prefer Trance, Progressive House, Drum & Bass and Chillout. You can find out more on my Spotify and Last.fm profiles.

I also love watching movies and series on Netflix and videos on YouTube.
