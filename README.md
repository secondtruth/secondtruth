# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Christian alias secondtruth, a hobbyist web developer and tech enthusiast from Stuttgart (Germany), who loves open source.

I'm currently working on [FlameCore](http://github.com/flamecore), a set of PHP libraries for common use cases. Besides that, I'm also working on my [personal website](https://secondtruth.de) and several other small web projects. In addition, I am experimenting with Go.


## :toolbox: My Skills

I love Go and PHP. I'm also a big fan of web technologies in general as well as Linux, Nginx, Caddy, Docker, and other open source software. PhpStorm and Visual Studio Code are my favorite editors.


## :thumbsup: My other Interests

When I'm not working on my projects, I also like to play strategy games, building games, simulations or RPGs.

I love music, too. My taste is very mixed, but I prefer Trance, Progressive House, Drum & Bass and Chillout. If you're interested, you can check out my Spotify and Last.fm profiles to learn more about my musical preferences.

I also enjoy watching movies and series on Netflix and videos on YouTube.
